interview_questions
===================

All the technical coding interview questions I could get my hands on, and attempted to solve. I also post these solutions on www.stephaniechou.com/blog

## Topics Covered
- Data Structures
  - linked lists
  - trees
  - arrays
  - hashes
  - stacks and queues
- Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming


## Notes on the problems
- Some are not complete.
- Some are completed in both Ruby and Javascript
- Quite a few are from actual interviews. I try not to identify which companies


## TODOs
I will be updating the organization of this repository so it is easier to navigate by topics and data structures
